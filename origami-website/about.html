      <p>
        Hello Everyone!<br><br>
        I’m <strong>Pratul Jagtap</strong>, the creator of this website. I built it for anyone who wants to learn how to create beautiful origami designs — whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned folder.<br><br>
        Origami is more than paper — it’s patience, art, and a little bit of magic. I hope you enjoy folding these designs as much as I enjoyed curating them for you.
